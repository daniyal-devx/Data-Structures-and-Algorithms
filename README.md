# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) â€“ C++

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms** in C++ as part of my coursework at PUCIT, along with additional practice problems.  
It will be updated throughout the semester as I explore different topics.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **Task 01 â€“ 3D Dynamic Array**  
  - Implemented a dynamically allocated 3D array using pointer notation.  
  - Practiced memory allocation, initialization, printing, and deallocation without memory leaks.  

- **Task 02 â€“ 2D to 1D Mapping**  
  - Designed a class to represent 2D arrays using a 1D dynamic array (column-major mapping).  
  - Implemented constructor, destructor, copy-constructor, operator overloading, and array utility functions.  

- *(More tasks will be added as the course progresses)*  

## âš¡ Topics Covered
- Arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, nD)
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Pointer arithmetic & notation
- Class design & operator overloading
- Array mapping (row-major & column-major)

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving and coding skills in C++  
- Build a strong foundation in DSA for competitive programming, technical interviews, and future projects

ðŸ“Œ *This repo will be continuously updated as I progress through my DSA course.*
